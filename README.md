# 🌬️ Wind Energy Production Prediction  

This project explores the use of data analytics and machine learning to predict wind energy output. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and linear regression modeling to understand and forecast wind energy generation based on key environmental features.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- 📈 Objective: Predict wind energy production using meteorological variables  
- 🧪 Techniques Used: Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Correlation Matrix, Linear Regression  
- 🛠️ Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn

- README.md – Project documentation

## 📊 Key Steps

1. 📁 Data Import & Preprocessing  
   - Handled null values and converted data types  
   - Visualized missing data with a heatmap  

2. 🔬 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
   - Histogram and density plots to understand distribution of features  
   - Boxplots to check for outliers  

3. 📌 Correlation Analysis  
   - Computed Pearson correlation between variables  
   - Heatmap to visualize relationships among wind speed, wind direction, temperature, etc.  

4. 🧠 Linear Regression Modeling  
   - Selected features most correlated with energy output  
   - Trained a simple regression model  
   - Evaluated model performance using R² score and residual analysis  

## 📈 Results

- Found wind speed and temperature to be the most significant predictors of energy output  
- Achieved decent model accuracy considering the linear approach  
- Highlighted the potential for more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) in future work
